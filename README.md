# Cement-Strength-Prediction

I have made this Project to predict the strength of **Cement**. \
The project takes in multiple csv files as input and first classifies them into good or bad files (according to schema), then predicts the result.\
The project follows a very structural approach and uses Flask Framework that provides a very intuitive UI. The Inputs are taken in the form of a .csv file and the Prediction file is also created in a .csv format.\
This app can be easily deployed on Heroku (deployment details are given below).
